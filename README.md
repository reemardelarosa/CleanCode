## Principles

### Right tool for the job.

#### Boundaries Matter
> HTML, JS, CSS should be written in their own respective file type.

#### Stay Native
- Cached
- Code Colored
- Syntax Checked
- Separation of concerns
- Reusable
- Avoid string parsing
- Can minify and obfuscate

##### Avoid using one language to write another language/format via strings. e.g Using strings in C#, Java, PHP, etc. to create
- Javascript
- XML
- HTML
- JSON
- CSS

#### Leverage Libraries
- One Language per file
- Every Tech is Potential Evil

### Maximize signal to noise ratio.

#### Signal
> Logic the folows the TED rule:
- **T**erse - should not excessively wordy.
- **E**xpressive - clear on what code is trying to do
- **D**o one thing - clear and one thing responsibility.

#### Noise
- High Cyclomatic Complexity
- Excessive Indentation
- Zombie Code
- Unnecessary Comments
- Poorly Named Structures
- Huge Classes
- Long Methods
- Repetition
- No Whitespace
- Overly Verbose

#### Why is signal to noise ration so important?
1. Our brain is the compiler.

### Self-documenting.

## Conditionals
## Functions
## Classes
